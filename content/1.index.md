They say the devil is in the details. I say that's where the magic happens. Want to know what drives me? [**Read more about me**](/about){.link}.

Currently building two tools I'm proud of: :icon{name="custom:shelve"} [_**Shelve**_](https://shelve.cloud){.link}, simplifying how teams share and manage environment variables, and :icon{name="custom:mockline"} [_**Mockline**_](https://mockline.dev){.link}, a component library that makes beautiful development effortless.

The best way to follow my work and thoughts is through [_**X/Twitter**_](https://dub.sh/hrcd-x){.link}**,** where I actively share my development journey, from technical insights to project updates or explore them on [**GitHub**](https://git.new/hugorcd){.link}, [I have a lot of open source projects, pieces of code, etc... where i'm sure you can find something useful for you.]{.blurred} And because life without music would be unimaginable, you can also check out my playlists on [**Spotify**](https://spti.fi/HugoRCD){.link}. I'm also on a platform that I don't like so much, [**LinkedIn**](https://dub.sh/hrcd-linkedin){.blurred.link}.
