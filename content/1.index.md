They say the devil is in the details. I say that's where the magic happens. Want to know what drives me? [**Read more about me**](/about){.link}.

Currently building two tools I'm proud of: [_**Shelve**_](https://shelve.cloud), simplifying how teams share and manage environment variables, and [_**Mockline**_](https://mockline.dev), a component library that makes beautiful development effortless. Explore my work: [**_/works_**](/works)

The best way to follow my work and thoughts is through [_**X/Twitter**_](https://twitter.com/HugoRCD__){.link}**,** where I actively share my development journey, from technical insights to project updates or explore them on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/HugoRCD){.link},[i have a lot of open source projects, pieces of code, etc... where i'm sure you can find something useful for you.]{.blurred} And because life without music would be unimaginable, you can also check out my playlists on [**Spotify**](https://spti.fi/HugoRCD){.link}.

I'm also on a platform that I don't like so much, [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hugo-richard-0801/){.blurred.link}.
