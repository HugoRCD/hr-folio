#timeline
This isn't just a timeline. It's a reflection of a journey fueled by an almost all-consuming passion for development. 
For me, coding is more than a job â€“ it's a craft I live and breathe, sometimes even in my dreams. 
Each point on this line represents a significant moment, a lesson learned, or a milestone that has shaped who I am as a developer and, in many ways, as a person. 
It maps the evolution of my skills, my thinking, and my ever-deepening love for building things that matter.

Looking back at these milestones, I'm reminded of how interconnected my life and my passion for development truly are. It's a journey I'm incredibly grateful for, filled with challenges that pushed me and successes that fueled me. This timeline component itself is a small product of that passion, crafted with the same care I try to bring to all my projects.

If you're curious about how it's built, you can find the [source code and dive deeper here](https://github.com/HugoRCD/hr-folio/blob/main/app/components/content/Timeline.vue).

This path is ever-evolving, and I'm genuinely excited for what comes next. Thank you for taking a moment to share in this piece of my story. If you're on a similar journey or want to build something cool, [I'd love to hear from you](/contact).
