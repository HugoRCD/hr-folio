# How Raycast Became My Ultimate Sidekick ?

Hey there, productivity enthusiasts! Let me take you on a journey through the magical land of Raycast â€“ an app that has completely revolutionized my workflow and made me wonder how I ever survived without it. Get ready for a rollercoaster ride filled with productivity hacks, time-saving tricks!

## **Snippets Magic:**

Tired of typing the same thing over and over again? Say no more! With Raycast's snippet feature! Whether it's your lengthy email signature, those never-ending Unix commands, or the perfect code snippet you use in every component, Raycast has got your back. For all those developers who have made the right career move and are on Nuxt, I've also written an article on the subject :prose-a[5 raycast snippets for Nuxt]{href="https://hrcd.fr//writing/5-amazing-raycast-nuxt-snippets"}.

## **Quicklinks, Warp Speed Navigation:**

Tired of navigating through your 'Dev' folder every single time only to end up opening your portfolio with a 'code .' command? Well, fret no more! With Raycast's Quicklinks, you can open anything, anywhere, lightning-fast. No more unnecessary folder diving!

All my current projects can be opened directly in WebStorm from Raycast.

## **AI Wizardry:**

Why bother with a dozen different AI services when Raycast brings the power of AI right to your fingertips? Translate text, summarize articles, generate ideas based on what you're reading, squash bugs in your code â€“ you name it, Raycast's got it covered.

I personally set the "Fix spelling and grammar" to the shortcut âŒ¥ âŒ¥ to never make spelling mistakes again.

I also use a lot my custom AI Command "Refacto" to make my code simpler and more maintainable. I simply select my code and run the command, then click on enter once the ia has finished its work and my new, clean, optimized code automatically replaces the old one. But also "Type to fake data" to generate fake data to test my api directly by selecting a type or interface! I made a tweet about it -> :prose-a[ðŸ”¥ Easy fake data]{href="https://x.com/HugoRCD__/status/1755528539309326706?s=20"}

## **Infinite Clipboard**:

Ever wish you could retrieve something you copied ages ago? With Raycast's Infinite Clipboard, you'll never lose your clipboard again. It's like having a photographic memory for your clipboard!

## **âœ¨Theâœ¨ Emoji Picker:**

Say goodbye to boring emoji selectors and hello to the emoji matrix of your dreams! With Raycast's emoji picker, you can express yourself in style faster than you can say "ðŸ˜ŽðŸ’»ðŸš€." Whether you're feeling ðŸ˜‚ or ðŸ˜¡, there's an emoji for every occasion â€“ and finding them has never been easier or more fun!

## **Extensions, one shortcut to rule them all:**

Who needs a gazillion different apps cluttering up their system when Raycast's got a whole arsenal of extensions ready to go? Raycast's extensions are like Swiss Army knives for your workflow â€“ They do it all: from creating tickets to generating Lorem Ipsum text, to fixing all your CORS errors. Okay, maybe not the last one, but who knows, maybe in the future, Raycast teams seem to work magic with every update.
