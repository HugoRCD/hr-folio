::about
Developer and art director based in Nice, France.

With over **7 years** of experience in the web industry, I have been working on a wide range of projects, from small websites to complex web applications.
Today I realized that **I'm tired of the actual web**, complex website, no real meaning, no real purpose, no real value. So now, I want to **make a change**, I want to make the web **more simple**, **more meaningful**, more valuable.
_Create things because they have to be created, not because they can be created_.

I started to search for a **new way to create**, a new way to think my projects. I found new tools to make everything more simple and efficient.
Now I will only use things that actually **make sense** and **match my values**.
