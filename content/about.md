#about
Some see code as just instructions for machines. I see it as an **art form**.

**Frontend Architect** based in Nice, France, with **7+ years of crafting digital experiences**. My journey started with
a simple curiosity about **how things work**. Today, that curiosity drives me to build tools that push boundaries
while remaining elegantly simple. _**"Create things because they have to be created, not because they can be
created"**_ — this philosophy guides everything I do. Shelve, my latest creation, embodies this evolution — what began
as a straightforward CLI tool has grown into an ambitious platform that challenges conventional thinking about developer
workflows. My expertise in :icon{align name="simple-icons:vuedotjs" size="18px"} **Vue.js** and 
:icon{align name="simple-icons:nuxtdotjs" size="20px"} **Nuxt** has shaped my approach to development. The discovery of these technologies
showed me that **true innovation isn't about adding more** — it's about **making the complex feel natural**. This
revelation pushed me to **embrace open-source development**, sharing my work with the community and learning from
every contribution and interaction. When I'm not crafting code, you'll find me scaling walls at the climbing gym or
hunting for that perfect photograph. These pursuits might seem unrelated to software development, but they've shaped my
approach in unexpected ways. Like finding the perfect grip on a climbing route,
_**sometimes the most elegant solution requires looking at problems from a different angle**_. The tech world often
races toward complexity. I prefer to **step back and ask "why?" before asking "how?"** It's this mindset that
transformed my understanding of development. Through open-source contributions and years of experience, I've learned
that the most powerful solutions are often the most thoughtfully simplified ones.

Currently, I'm working on:

- Building Shelve into something extraordinary
- Contributing to open-source projects that matter
- Pushing the boundaries of modern web architecture with Vue.js & Nuxt
- Finding beauty in the details others overlook
- Sharing knowledge and experiences with the community
