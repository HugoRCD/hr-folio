The best way to follow my work and thoughts is through [***X/Twitter***](https://dub.sh/hrcd-x){.link}**,** where I actively share my development journey, from technical insights to project updates or explore them on [**GitHub**](https://git.new/hugorcd){.link}, [I have many open-source projects, snippets of code, and more, where I'm sure you'll find something useful for you. You can also check some out [here](/playground){.link}.]{.blurred} And because life without music would be unimaginable, you can also check out my playlists on [**Spotify**](https://spti.fi/HugoRCD){.link}. I'm also on a platform that I don't like so much, [**LinkedIn**](https://dub.sh/hrcd-linkedin){.blurred.link}. Oh ! And I recently start streaming on [**Twitch**](https://dub.sh/hugo-twitch){.link} !
